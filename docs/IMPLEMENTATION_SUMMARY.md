# TheSet Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Created Spotify Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/spotify/`)
- Server-side Spotify API calls to avoid CORS issues
- Supports artist search, top tracks, and track search
- Includes rate limiting, retry logic, and circuit breakers
- Uses app credentials (Client ID/Secret) for authentication

### 2. Updated Spotify Client (`/src/integrations/spotify/client.ts`)
- Refactored to use Edge Function for server-side operations
- Removed direct API calls that caused CORS errors
- Maintained user-specific functions for personalized data
- Added new `searchTracks` function for song suggestions

### 3. Fixed ShowPage (`/src/pages/ShowPage.tsx`)
- Removed dependency on user's Spotify token for initial setlist
- Now uses Edge Function to fetch artist top tracks
- Automatically updates artist with Spotify ID if missing
- Removed ALL mock data - setlists use real Spotify data

### 4. Implemented Song Suggestions (`/src/components/shows/SongSuggestionDialog.tsx`)
- Full-featured song search using Spotify catalog
- Add suggested songs to existing setlists
- Marks suggested songs with `suggested: true` flag
- Real-time UI updates after adding songs

## How It Works Now

1. **User visits a show page**
   - System checks for existing setlist
   - If none exists, searches for artist on Spotify
   - Fetches top 10 tracks via Edge Function
   - Creates setlist with initial 0 votes

2. **Sync System Integration**
   - `sync-popular-tours` imports shows from Ticketmaster
   - `sync-artist-songs` pre-caches artist catalogs
   - Edge Functions handle on-demand Spotify requests

3. **Song Suggestions**
   - Users search Spotify's full catalog
   - Selected songs added to show's setlist
   - All users see updated setlist immediately

## Configuration Required

### Supabase Edge Functions Environment Variables
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
```

### Deploy Commands
```bash
supabase functions deploy spotify
supabase functions deploy sync-artist-songs
supabase functions deploy sync-popular-tours
```

## Key Improvements

1. **No More CORS Errors**: All Spotify API calls go through Edge Functions
2. **Real Data Only**: Completely removed mock/fallback data
3. **Efficient Caching**: Songs cached in database, reducing API calls
4. **Complete Feature**: Song suggestions fully implemented
5. **Production Ready**: Includes error handling, rate limiting, and logging

## Next Steps

1. Set up cron jobs for automatic syncing
2. Monitor API usage and adjust rate limits
3. Consider implementing user-specific playlists
4. Add analytics for popular song suggestions
