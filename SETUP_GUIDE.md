   - Creates a setlist with real songs and initial vote counts
   - Caches the songs for performance

2. **Smart Voting**: 
   - Prevents duplicate votes with proper error messages
   - Updates UI immediately after voting
   - Handles authentication errors gracefully

3. **Performance**: 
   - Caches Spotify data to minimize API calls
   - Uses real-time query invalidation for instant updates
   - Implements rate limiting and retry logic
